# You can create a beautiful address for your wallet by generating addresses and searching them for the parameters you need.

## Customization:
CHAT_ID = "CHATAYDI" - Add your telegram id here (you can find out from the bot) @getmyid_bot
BOT_TOKEN = "BOT TOKEN" - can be created in a BotFather bot
If the address you specified is found, it will come to you in the cart.


## In the Fields below, we substitute your values, the fewer characters, the faster the address will be found.
```python
if acct.address[:8] == "0x666666" and acct.address[-10:] == "6666666666":
```
```python "0x666666"``` ```- The first digits in the address ```

```python [:8]``` - Number of characters

```python "6666666666"``` - the last digits in the address
```python [-10:]``` - number of characters
